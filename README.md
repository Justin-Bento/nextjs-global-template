# Nextjs Global Tempalte

This project is mainly for me to save time when building applications for clients. Anyone can use it who wants a simple Nextjs startup app, that removes the confusing headace of Nextjs.

## Installation

We recommend forking the repository to receive updates and changes made to the project over time.

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Project

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```
### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

Consider creating a dedicated development folder in your home directory to organize your projects:

```bash
mkdir ~/development
cd ~/development
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the development server using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a custom font designed for Vercel projects.
